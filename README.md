# UPC-AIDL-bAbI-VQA
Project for the Postgraduate in Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence at UPC. The project aims to address bAbl and VQA tasks. 

This project is trying to find the best optimized hyperparameters in terms of *accuracy* and *training time* for the [Facebook bAbl tasks](https://research.fb.com/downloads/babi/). We are aiming to do this automatically and find the best setting for getting towards a good model. 

Furthermore, we are attempting to address the [VQA](https://visualqa.org/) by trying different networks at the same time. 

## Requirements
You will need Graphviz to be installed in your machine

``` bash
pip install keras
pip install gitpython
pip install pydot
```
